 Logger

A structured logger.

## Design

The logger is designed with the idea of following closely the severity levels as defined in [RFC5424](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424).

A partial `log` compatibility layer is available by importing `github.com/tzvetkoff-go/logger/compat/log`.

## Usage

See [example.go](examples/example.go) for an example.
